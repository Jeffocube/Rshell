# Introduction:
The program we are creating will be a shell called RShell. It will have some of the capabilities of the current shell we use, bash. This includes printing a command prompt, taking in user input, and translating those commands into services that the user requests. For this assignment, we will use the Composite Pattern as our framework for the program. This is important as the user will be entering different inputs and the having a composite pattern will allow the user to treat all the objects in the program in the same manner.
